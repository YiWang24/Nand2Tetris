# Nand2Tetris Projects (Chapters 1-6)

This repository contains implementations of the projects from the book [_The Elements of Computing Systems_](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), also known as Nand2Tetris.

## Project Overview

### 01 - Boolean Logic

- **Description**: Implementation of basic logic gates using the NAND gate. Builds up fundamental gates like NOT, AND, OR, XOR, multiplexer (MUX), and demultiplexer (DMUX).
- **Content**: HDL (Hardware Description Language) files for each gate.

### 02 - Boolean Arithmetic

- **Description**: Construction of arithmetic circuits, including adders and incrementers. Focuses on building a 16-bit Adder and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
- **Content**: HDL files for arithmetic chips.

### 03 - Sequential Logic

- **Description**: Introduction to sequential logic circuits. Implementation of flip-flops, registers, RAM units, and the program counter.
- **Content**: HDL files for memory components.

### 04 - Machine Language

- **Description**: Writing simple programs in the Hack assembly language. Understanding the machine language and how programs are executed.
- **Content**: Assembly (`.asm`) files with programs like `Mult.asm` and `Fill.asm`.

### 05 - Computer Architecture

- **Description**: Integration of all previously built components to construct the Hack computer. Includes the CPU and memory systems.
- **Content**: HDL files for the CPU and the complete computer system.

### 06 - Assembler

- **Description**: Development of an assembler that translates Hack assembly code into machine code. Solidifies understanding of symbolic machine language translation.
- **Content**: Source code for the assembler written in a high-level language (e.g., JavaScript, Python).
